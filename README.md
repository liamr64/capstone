# capstone
This project is designed to model university housing lotteries.  It is not yet fully documented (but it will be)

In this folder exists the following
1. .vscode contians my IDE settings
2. Capstone- some numbers are bot credentials for any public google drive file (if this could access anything other than public information it wouldn't be on here, but it can't so I'm not worried about it)
3. Capstone.py - this polls my sample data file in its entirity and puts information in the database - currently works, but needs to be refined
4.deleteEverything.sql - clears database, used for testing, might delete at end of project
5.index.php - up to date file for webpage
6. index1.php - old webpage, keeping so that I don't have to use git to revert
7. makeDatabase.sql - needs to be updated, but creates a databse pretty close to the one that is live currently, will update with MYSQL's extract tool
8. model.py -this is the acual model, is about 40% of the way dones as of 3/11
9. test.py - dummy file for testing things I want to keep seperate from an actual code base, will be deleted at the end of project
